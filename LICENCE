cosmoabc - Likelihood-free inference via Population Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation 

cosmoabc is a package which enables parameter inference using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) 
algorithm, as described in Ishida et al., 2015 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06129).

The code was originally designed for cosmological parameter inference from galaxy clusters number 
counts based on Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich measurements. In this context, the cosmological simulations 
were performed using the NumCosmo library (http://www.nongnu.org/numcosmo/).

Nevertheless, the user can easily take advantage of the ABC sampler along with his/her own simulator, 
as well as test personalized prior distributions and distance functions.
