CosmoABC uses functionalities of a number of different libraries and
in addition also provides subpackages.


Subpackages
-----------
Using any of these subpackages requires an explicit import.  For example,
``import CosmoABC.priors``.

::

 ABC_sampler                  --- ABC acceptance/rejection algorithm
 priors                       --- prior probability distribution functions
 distances                    --- distance functions between 2 catalogs
 plots                        --- Plotting rotines
 sim_NumCosmo                 --- Simulation setup for NumCosmo library
